# IGovernable

The `IGovernable` interface is a core part of the Gyroscope protocol, providing a standardized way for contracts to be governed and managed. This interface defines the essential functions and events for contract governance, ensuring a consistent and secure way for the protocol to be updated and modified over time.

At the heart of the `IGovernable` interface is the concept of a **governor**. The governor is the entity responsible for making changes to the protocol, such as updating system parameters, registering new vaults, or changing critical configuration settings. The `IGovernable` interface ensures that only the current governor can perform these privileged actions.

The key features of the `IGovernable` interface include:

- **Changing the Governor**: The `changeGovernor` function allows the current governor to transfer governance to a new address. This is an important function, as it allows for a smooth transition of power and ensures that the protocol can continue to evolve under the guidance of trusted individuals or organizations.

The ability to change the governor is critical for the long-term sustainability of the Gyroscope protocol. It allows the project to adapt to changing circumstances and ensure that governance remains in the hands of responsible and capable individuals.

- **Accepting Governance**: The `acceptGovernance` function allows a pending governor to officially take over governance of the contract. This two-step process (proposing a new governor, then accepting the governance) helps to ensure that governance changes are transparent and deliberate.

- **Governance Events**: The `IGovernable` interface defines two events that are emitted whenever the governor is changed: `GovernorChanged` and `GovernorChangeRequested`. These events help to provide a clear audit trail of governance changes and allow external parties to monitor the protocol's governance.

Here's an example of how the `IGovernable` interface might be used in the Gyroscope protocol:

<Steps>
### Step 1
The current governor, Alice, decides that it's time to transfer governance of the `PrimaryAMMV1` contract to a new address, Bob. Alice calls the `changeGovernor` function, passing Bob's address as the new governor.

### Step 2
The Gyroscope community is notified of the pending governance change through the `GovernorChangeRequested` event. This gives everyone a chance to review the proposed change and provide feedback.

### Step 3
After a suitable review period, Bob calls the `acceptGovernance` function to officially become the new governor of the `PrimaryAMMV1` contract. The `GovernorChanged` event is emitted, solidifying the governance transition.
</Steps>

The `IGovernable` interface is a crucial part of the Gyroscope protocol, ensuring that the project can be managed and updated in a secure and transparent way. By providing a standardized approach to governance, the Gyroscope team can focus on building innovative DeFi features while maintaining the trust and confidence of the community.
