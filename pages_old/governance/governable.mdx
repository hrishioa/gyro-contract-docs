# Governable

The `Governable` contract is a core part of the Gyroscope protocol's governance system. It provides a standard way for managing the governor, or the entity responsible for making important decisions about the protocol.

The `Governable` contract inherits from the `GovernableBase` contract, which contains the core logic for governor management. This includes functions for **changing the governor**, **accepting governance**, and **checking the current and pending governor**.

## Governor Management

The governor of the Gyroscope protocol is the entity responsible for making critical decisions, such as:

- Updating system parameters
- Adding or removing trusted oracles
- Configuring the protocol's global settings

The `Governable` contract ensures that only the current governor can perform these sensitive actions. This is achieved through the use of the `governanceOnly` modifier, which checks that the caller is the current governor before allowing the function to proceed.

<Callout type="info">
The governor is initially set during the deployment of the `Governable` contract, and can be changed by the current governor using the `changeGovernor` function.
</Callout>

## Accepting Governance

When the governor is changed, the new governor must **accept the change** before they can start exercising their responsibilities. This is done through the `acceptGovernance` function, which can only be called by the pending governor.

This two-step process - changing the governor and then accepting the change - helps to ensure that the transition of governance is deliberate and secure.

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how the `Governable` contract might be used in the Gyroscope protocol:

```solidity
// In the PrimaryAMMV1 contract
contract PrimaryAMMV1 is Governable {
    // ...

    function setSystemParams(Params memory params) external governanceOnly {
        // Only the current governor can update the system parameters
        systemParams = params;
    }

    // ...
}
```

In this example, the `PrimaryAMMV1` contract inherits from `Governable` and uses the `governanceOnly` modifier to ensure that only the current governor can update the system parameters.

By using the `Governable` contract, the Gyroscope protocol can maintain a secure and transparent governance system, where important decisions are made by a trusted entity and the transition of governance is carefully managed.
