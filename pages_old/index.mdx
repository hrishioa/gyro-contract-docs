# Introduction

The Gyroscope protocol is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that focuses on building a robust and stable stablecoin. At the core of Gyroscope is the **Primary Automated Market Maker (PAMM)**, which is responsible for the pricing and minting/redemption mechanics of the Gyroscope Dollar (GYD) token.

The Gyroscope protocol is designed to provide a reliable and transparent stablecoin that can be used as a medium of exchange and store of value in the DeFi ecosystem. The key components that make up the Gyroscope protocol are:

- **PAMM (Primary AMM)**: The primary pricing and minting/redemption mechanism for the GYD token.
- **Vaults**: Liquidity pools that hold the underlying assets backing the GYD token.
- **Motherboard**: The central contract that coordinates the various components of the Gyroscope protocol.
- **Oracle**: Price feeds that provide accurate and up-to-date pricing information for the assets in the Gyroscope reserve.
- **Reserve**: The contract that manages the deposits and withdrawals of the underlying assets.

The Gyroscope protocol is designed to be highly composable, allowing it to be integrated with other DeFi protocols and applications. This makes it a powerful building block for the broader DeFi ecosystem.
