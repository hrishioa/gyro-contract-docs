# IRelativePriceOracle

The `IRelativePriceOracle` is the interface contract that provides the relative price between two assets. This is a crucial part of the Gyroscope protocol, as it allows the primary AMM pricing mechanism, [PAMM](/core-contracts/pamm), to accurately determine the redemption value of the Gyro dollar (GYD).

The relative price between two assets is defined as the number of units of the quote asset required to purchase one unit of the base asset. For example, if the relative price of ETH to DAI is 2000, it means that 2000 DAI are required to purchase 1 ETH.

The interface defines two main functions:

1. `getRelativePrice(address baseToken, address quoteToken)`: This function returns the relative price between the `baseToken` and the `quoteToken`. The price is always scaled with 18 decimals, regardless of the source used for the oracle.

2. `isPairSupported(address baseToken, address quoteToken)`: This function returns a boolean indicating whether the oracle currently supports prices for the `baseToken` relative to the `quoteToken`.

The relative price oracle is responsible for providing accurate and up-to-date price information to the protocol. It is a critical component that ensures the stability and fairness of the Gyroscope system.
</Callout>

The `IRelativePriceOracle` interface is implemented by a concrete oracle contract, such as the `CheckedPriceOracle`, which performs additional checks and validations on the relative prices. This helps ensure the integrity of the price data and protects the protocol from potential price manipulation or other attacks.

By using this interface, the Gyroscope protocol can easily integrate with different relative price oracles, allowing for flexibility and adaptability as the DeFi landscape evolves. This modular design ensures that the protocol can remain robust and secure, even as new challenges and requirements arise.

Overall, the `IRelativePriceOracle` is a crucial component of the Gyroscope protocol, providing the necessary price information to the primary AMM and other key parts of the system. Its implementation and integration into the protocol demonstrate the team's commitment to building a secure and reliable decentralized stablecoin solution.
