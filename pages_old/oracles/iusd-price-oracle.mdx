# IUSDPriceOracle

The `IUSDPriceOracle` is the interface that provides the ability to fetch the USD price of a given asset. This is a crucial component in the Gyroscope protocol, as many of the core functionality, such as minting and redeeming, rely on accurate USD pricing information.

<Callout type="info">
The USD price is always scaled with 18 decimals, regardless of the source used for the oracle. This ensures consistent pricing across the protocol.
</Callout>

The interface has a single function, `getPriceUSD`, which takes the address of an asset and returns its USD price:

```solidity
/// @notice Quotes the USD price of `tokenAddress`
/// The quoted price is always scaled with 18 decimals regardless of the
/// source used for the oracle.
/// @param tokenAddress the asset of which the price is to be quoted
/// @return the USD price of the asset
function getPriceUSD(address tokenAddress) external view returns (uint256);
```

This function is used extensively throughout the Gyroscope protocol, for example in the [PAMM](/core-contracts/pamm) contract to calculate the appropriate amounts for minting and redeeming Gyro Dollars (GYD).

The implementation of the `IUSDPriceOracle` interface is provided by the [CheckedPriceOracle](/oracles/checked-price-oracle) contract, which performs additional checks and validations on the USD prices to ensure they are up-to-date and consistent.

<Callout type="warning">
It's crucial that the USD price oracle provides accurate and reliable pricing information, as any issues could lead to significant problems in the Gyroscope protocol. The `CheckedPriceOracle` contract is designed to mitigate these risks through various safety checks.

Overall, the `IUSDPriceOracle` interface is a core component of the Gyroscope protocol, providing the foundation for accurate pricing and, in turn, the proper functioning of the entire system.
