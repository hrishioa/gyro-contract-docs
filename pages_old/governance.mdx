# Governance

The Gyroscope protocol employs a robust governance system to ensure the long-term health and evolution of the ecosystem. The key aspects of the governance model are outlined in this section.

## Governor and Governable Contracts

At the heart of the Gyroscope governance system are the **Governor** and **Governable** contracts. The **Governor** contract holds the authority to make changes to the protocol, while the **Governable** contracts are the ones that can be modified by the Governor.

<Callout type="info">
The Governor is typically a multi-sig wallet or a DAO controlled by the community, ensuring decentralized decision-making.
</Callout>

The **Governable** contracts in the Gyroscope protocol include:

- [PrimaryAMMV1](/core-contracts/pamm) (the primary AMM pricing mechanism)
- [IGyroConfig](/core-contracts/igyro-config) (the global configuration contract)
- [ReserveSafetyManager](/core-contracts/isafety-check) (the contract responsible for checking the safety of mint and redeem operations)

Through the **Governable** contracts, the Governor can update critical parameters, add or remove authorized addresses, and make other important modifications to the protocol.

## Governance Workflow

The typical governance workflow in the Gyroscope protocol is as follows:

<Steps>
### Step 1: Proposal Submission
Community members can submit governance proposals to the Governor contract, outlining the changes they believe are necessary for the protocol.

### Step 2: Proposal Review
The Governor reviews the proposal, evaluates its potential impact, and determines whether it should be put to a vote.

### Step 3: Voting
If the proposal is accepted, the Governor initiates a voting period, during which the community can participate in the decision-making process.

### Step 4: Execution
If the proposal is approved by the community, the Governor can then execute the changes by interacting with the relevant Governable contracts.
</Steps>

This governance model ensures that the Gyroscope protocol can adapt to the evolving needs of the DeFi ecosystem, while maintaining a high degree of community involvement and control.

## Examples of Governance Decisions

Some examples of governance decisions that the Gyroscope community may consider include:

- Adjusting the parameters of the [PrimaryAMMV1](/core-contracts/pamm) contract, such as the `alphaBar`, `xuBar`, or `thetaBar` values, to fine-tune the pricing mechanism.
- Updating the [IGyroConfig](/core-contracts/igyro-config) contract to add or remove supported assets, adjust fee structures, or modify other global configuration settings.
- Changing the address of the [ReserveSafetyManager](/core-contracts/isafety-check) contract to upgrade the safety checks for mint and redeem operations.
- Approving new [IGyroVault](/core-contracts/igyro-vault) implementations to support additional types of liquidity pools.

By empowering the community to make these decisions, the Gyroscope protocol ensures that it remains adaptable and responsive to the needs of its users.

## Conclusion

The Gyroscope governance system is designed to be decentralized, transparent, and community-driven. By leveraging the Governor and Governable contracts, the protocol can evolve over time while maintaining the trust and involvement of its stakeholders. This governance model is a crucial component of the Gyroscope ecosystem, ensuring its long-term sustainability and success.
