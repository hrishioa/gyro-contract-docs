# IGyroVault

The `IGyroVault` interface defines the standard interface for a vault component within the Gyroscope protocol. Each vault is a ERC-20 token that represents the ownership of the underlying liquidity pool (e.g. Balancer, Curve, Uniswap) deposited in the vault.

The key responsibilities of the `IGyroVault` interface are:

1. **Deposit and Withdraw Liquidity**: Allows users to deposit and withdraw the underlying liquidity pool tokens in exchange for the vault's ERC-20 tokens. This is done through the `deposit()`, `depositFor()`, `withdraw()` and `dryWithdraw()` functions.

2. **Vault Token Metadata**: Provides information about the vault's token, such as the name, symbol, and decimals through standard ERC-20 metadata functions.

3. **Underlying Token Information**: Allows retrieving information about the underlying tokens associated with the vault through the `underlying()` and `getTokens()` functions.

4. **Total Underlying Balance**: Exposes the total amount of underlying tokens held by the vault through the `totalUnderlying()` function.

5. **Exchange Rate**: Provides the current exchange rate between the vault's token and the underlying tokens through the `exchangeRate()` function.

6. **Strategy Management**: Allows the governance to set the address of the strategy contract to be used for the vault through the `setStrategy()` function.

7. **Deployment Metadata**: Exposes the block number at which the vault was deployed through the `deployedAt()` function.

Here's an example of how the `deposit()` function can be used:

<Steps>
### Step 1

To deposit underlying tokens into the vault, the user first needs to approve the vault contract to spend the required amount of underlying tokens on their behalf:

```solidity
IERC20(underlyingToken).approve(vaultAddress, underlyingAmount);
```

### Step 2

Then, the user can call the `deposit()` function on the vault, passing the amount of underlying tokens to deposit and the minimum number of vault tokens they are willing to receive:

```solidity
uint256 vaultTokensReceived = IGyroVault(vaultAddress).deposit(underlyingAmount, minVaultTokensOut);
```

The function will transfer the underlying tokens from the user to the vault, and mint the corresponding amount of vault tokens to the user's address. The returned `vaultTokensReceived` value represents the actual amount of vault tokens minted.
</Steps>

The `IGyroVault` interface is a crucial component of the Gyroscope protocol, as it provides a standardized way for users to interact with the underlying liquidity pools through the vault's ERC-20 token. This abstraction allows for greater flexibility and composability within the broader Gyroscope ecosystem.
