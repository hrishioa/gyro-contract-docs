# IGyroVault

The **IGyroVault** interface defines the standard for a vault component in the Gyroscope protocol. A vault is a fundamental building block of the Gyroscope reserve, and has a one-to-one mapping to an underlying pool (e.g., a Balancer, Curve, or Uniswap pool).

The vault itself is an ERC-20 token that tracks the ownership of the LP tokens deposited in the underlying pool. Additionally, a vault can be associated with a strategy to generate yield on the deposited funds.

Let's dive into the key functions and features of the `IGyroVault` interface:

## Vault Properties
The `IGyroVault` interface provides several getters to inspect the properties of a vault:

- `vaultType()`: Returns the type of the vault, which can be one of the following: `GENERIC`, `BALANCER_CPMM`, `BALANCER_2CLP`, `BALANCER_3CLP`, or `BALANCER_ECLP`.
- `underlying()`: Returns the token associated with this vault, which is typically an LP token.
- `getTokens()`: Returns the underlying tokens associated with this vault, which are the tokens that make up the LP token.
- `totalUnderlying()`: Returns the total amount of underlying tokens in the vault.
- `exchangeRate()`: Returns the exchange rate between the underlying tokens and the vault's token.
- `deployedAt()`: Returns the block at which the vault was deployed.

## Depositing and Withdrawing
The vault allows users to deposit and withdraw the underlying tokens:

<Steps>
### Step 1: Deposit
Users can deposit the underlying tokens into the vault using the `deposit()` function. This function takes the amount of underlying tokens to deposit and a minimum amount of vault tokens to receive in return.

### Step 2: Withdraw
Users can withdraw the underlying tokens from the vault using the `withdraw()` function. This function takes the amount of vault tokens to burn and a minimum amount of underlying tokens to receive in return.
</Steps>

Both the `deposit()` and `withdraw()` functions have a "dry run" version, `dryDeposit()` and `dryWithdraw()`, that allow users to simulate the operation and get the expected results without modifying the state of the vault.

<Callout type="info">
The `deposit()` and `withdraw()` functions emit events that can be used to track deposit and withdrawal activities.
</Callout>

## Strategy Management
The vault can be associated with a strategy to generate yield on the deposited funds. The strategy is managed through the following functions:

- `strategy()`: Returns the address of the current strategy used by the vault.
- `setStrategy(address strategyAddress)`: Sets the address of the strategy contract that should follow the `IStrategy` interface.

The strategy contract is expected to implement the necessary logic to earn yield on the deposited funds, while the vault serves as the interface for users to interact with the underlying pool.

## Example Usage
Here's an example of how a user might interact with a `IGyroVault` instance:

```solidity
IGyroVault vault = IGyroVault(vaultAddress);

// Deposit 100 underlying tokens
uint256 vaultTokenAmount = vault.deposit(100, 50);
console.log("Received", vaultTokenAmount, "vault tokens");

// Withdraw 50 vault tokens
uint256 underlyingAmount = vault.withdraw(50, 10);
console.log("Received", underlyingAmount, "underlying tokens");
```

In this example, the user deposits 100 underlying tokens into the vault and receives in return some amount of vault tokens. The user then withdraws 50 vault tokens and receives the corresponding amount of underlying tokens.
