# ISafetyCheck

The `ISafetyCheck` interface is a critical component of the Gyroscope protocol, responsible for ensuring the safety and stability of the system during mint and redeem operations. This contract is designed to perform comprehensive checks on the state of the reserve and the proposed changes, before allowing any potentially risky actions to be executed.

The main functions defined in this interface are:

**`isMintSafe(DataTypes.Order memory order) external view returns (string memory)`**
This function takes an `Order` struct, which contains information about the proposed mint operation, and returns an empty string if the operation is safe, or an error message if it is not. The checks performed include:

- Verifying that all vault tokens have sufficient prices (not "dust" values)
- Ensuring that all stablecoins in the reserve are on their intended peg
- Confirming that the proposed changes to the vault weights do not cause any vault to fall outside of an acceptable deviation from its ideal weight

**`isRedeemSafe(DataTypes.Order memory order) external view returns (string memory)`**
Similar to the `isMintSafe` function, this one checks the safety of a proposed redeem operation. The main checks include:

- Ensuring that the requested redeem amounts do not exceed the available reserves in the vaults
- Verifying that the vault tokens have sufficient prices
- Confirming that the proposed changes to the vault weights do not cause any vault to fall outside of an acceptable deviation from its ideal weight

**`checkAndPersistMint(DataTypes.Order memory order) external view`**
This function is called when an actual mint operation is being performed. It first checks the safety of the operation using the `isMintSafe` function, and if the operation is deemed safe, it stores any relevant information for future reference.

**`checkAndPersistRedeem(DataTypes.Order memory order) external view`**
This function is called when an actual redeem operation is being performed. It first checks the safety of the operation using the `isRedeemSafe` function, and if the operation is deemed safe, it stores any relevant information for future reference.

The `ISafetyCheck` interface is a crucial part of the Gyroscope protocol, as it helps to prevent the system from entering an unsafe state, which could lead to loss of user funds or other undesirable outcomes. By performing these safety checks, the Gyroscope protocol can maintain a high level of security and stability, even as the system grows and evolves over time.
