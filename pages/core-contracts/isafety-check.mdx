# ISafetyCheck

The **ISafetyCheck** interface is a crucial component in the Gyroscope protocol, responsible for ensuring the safety and integrity of mint and redeem operations. This contract performs various checks to verify that the proposed actions do not violate the protocol's constraints and can be safely executed.

## Safety Checks

The `ISafetyCheck` interface defines two main functions:

1. **`isMintSafe(DataTypes.Order memory order)`**: This function checks whether a proposed mint operation is safe. It examines the order, which contains information about the vaults and amounts involved in the mint, and returns an empty string if the operation is safe, or an error message if it is not.

2. **`isRedeemSafe(DataTypes.Order memory order)`**: This function checks whether a proposed redeem operation is safe. It also examines the order and returns an empty string if the operation is safe, or an error message if it is not.

In addition to these two functions, the `ISafetyCheck` interface also defines two more functions:

3. **`checkAndPersistMint(DataTypes.Order memory order)`**: This function first checks the safety of the mint operation using `isMintSafe()`, and then, if the operation is deemed safe, persists the relevant information for the mint.

4. **`checkAndPersistRedeem(DataTypes.Order memory order)`**: This function first checks the safety of the redeem operation using `isRedeemSafe()`, and then, if the operation is deemed safe, persists the relevant information for the redeem.

<Callout type="info">
The `checkAndPersist*` functions are only called when an actual mint or redeem operation is performed, whereas the `isSafe*` functions can be used to simulate the operation and check its feasibility without modifying any state.
</Callout>

## Safety Checks Implementation

The safety checks implemented in the `ISafetyCheck` interface are designed to ensure the following:

1. **Token Prices**: The checks ensure that all tokens involved in the mint or redeem operation have sufficiently large prices, to avoid numerical errors or dust amounts.
2. **Stablecoin Peg**: The checks ensure that all stablecoin assets involved in the mint or redeem operation are close enough to their expected peg value (e.g., $1 for USDC).
3. **Vault Weights**: The checks ensure that the resulting weights of the vaults involved in the operation are within an acceptable range of their ideal weights, or that the operation promotes rebalancing if the vaults are outside the acceptable range.

The implementation of these safety checks is done in the `ReserveSafetyManager` contract, which is an `ISafetyCheck` implementation. The key steps in the safety checks are:

<Steps>
### Step 1: Build Metadata

The first step is to build a `DataTypes.Metadata` struct that contains all the relevant information about the vaults involved in the mint or redeem operation. This includes the current and resulting weights, prices, and whether the vaults contain stablecoins that are off their peg.

### Step 2: Update Metadata with Price Safety

The next step is to update the `DataTypes.Metadata` struct with information about the price safety of the assets in each vault. This involves checking that all stablecoins are sufficiently close to their peg, and that at least one asset in each vault has a sufficiently large price to avoid numerical errors.

### Step 3: Update Metadata with Epsilon Status

The third step is to update the `DataTypes.Metadata` struct with information about whether the resulting weights of the vaults are within an acceptable range (epsilon) of their ideal weights.

### Step 4: Evaluate Safety Conditions

The final step is to evaluate the safety conditions based on the information in the `DataTypes.Metadata` struct. This includes checking that:
1. All vaults are using sufficiently large token prices.
2. All stablecoins are either on their peg or the operation promotes rebalancing of the vaults with off-peg stablecoins.
3. All vaults are either within the acceptable weight range or the operation promotes rebalancing of the vaults outside the range.
</Steps>

The `ReserveSafetyManager` contract implements these safety checks and provides the `isMintSafe()` and `isRedeemSafe()` functions, as well as the `checkAndPersistMint()` and `checkAndPersistRedeem()` functions.

## Examples

Let's consider a few examples of how the `ISafetyCheck` interface and the `ReserveSafetyManager` contract work:

1. **Mint Operation**: Suppose a user wants to mint some Gyro Dollars (GYD) by depositing a mix of tokens into the reserve. The `isMintSafe()` function will first build the `DataTypes.Metadata` struct, then check that all token prices are sufficiently large and that the resulting vault weights are either within the acceptable range or promote rebalancing. If these checks pass, the function will return an empty string, indicating that the mint operation is safe to execute.

2. **Redeem Operation**: When a user wants to redeem some GYD tokens, the `isRedeemSafe()` function will first check that the user is not trying to redeem more than the reserve can accommodate. It will then build the `DataTypes.Metadata` struct and perform the same checks as for the mint operation. If all checks pass, the function will return an empty string, indicating that the redeem operation is safe to execute.

3. **Off-Peg Stablecoins**: If the safety checks detect that a vault contains a stablecoin that is significantly off its peg, the `isMintSafe()` function will return an error message unless the operation promotes rebalancing of that vault (i.e., the resulting weight of the vault is lower than the current weight). This is to ensure that the protocol does not allow minting in a way that could exacerbate the off-peg situation.

By implementing these comprehensive safety checks, the Gyroscope protocol can ensure that mint and redeem operations do not introduce unacceptable risks to the system, even in the presence of volatile or misbehaving assets.
