# IGyroConfig

The `IGyroConfig` interface is a crucial component of the Gyroscope protocol, as it stores and manages the global configuration settings for the entire ecosystem. This contract acts as a centralized source of truth for various parameters and addresses that are used across multiple contracts within the protocol.

The `IGyroConfig` interface provides the following key functionalities:

1. **Configuration Management**: It allows the protocol's governance to set, update, and unset various configuration parameters, such as addresses of core contracts, fee rates, and other protocol-wide settings.
2. **Configuration Freezing**: The interface also enables the freezing of certain configuration parameters, making them immutable and preventing further changes.
3. **Configuration Querying**: The `IGyroConfig` contract provides functions to retrieve the current values of configuration parameters, as well as check if a specific parameter exists and whether it has been frozen.

## Configuration Parameters

The configuration parameters managed by the `IGyroConfig` interface include, but are not limited to:

- Addresses of core Gyroscope contracts, such as the [Motherboard](/imotherboard), [Reserve](/ireserve), and [PAMM](/pamm) contracts.
- Protocol fee rates, such as the flash loan fee and swap fee.
- Volatility thresholds for asset prices.
- Parameters related to the vault weight management, such as the maximum allowed deviation from the ideal weight.
- Addresses of authorized entities, such as the [Oracle Guardian](/oracle-integration) and [Safety Check](/isafety-check) contracts.

<Callout type="info">
The specific configuration parameters and their usage are documented in the respective sections of this handbook, such as [PAMM](/pamm) and [Oracle Integration](/oracle-integration).

## Configuration Interaction

Interactions with the `IGyroConfig` interface are typically performed by the protocol's governance, which has the authority to update the configuration settings. However, other contracts within the Gyroscope ecosystem may also need to access these configuration parameters to perform their respective functions.

For example, the [Motherboard](/imotherboard) contract may need to retrieve the address of the [Reserve](/ireserve) contract to facilitate the minting and redemption of Gyro Dollars (GYD). Similarly, the [PAMM](/pamm) contract may need to access the volatility thresholds and other parameters related to the primary AMM pricing mechanism.

The following diagram illustrates the interactions between the `IGyroConfig` interface and other Gyroscope contracts:

  PAMM <-- IGyroConfig

```

By providing a centralized and well-defined interface for managing protocol-wide configurations, the `IGyroConfig` contract plays a crucial role in ensuring the consistent and coordinated behavior of the Gyroscope ecosystem.

## Conclusion

The `IGyroConfig` interface is a essential component of the Gyroscope protocol, as it allows the protocol's governance to manage the global configuration settings. This contract serves as a source of truth for various parameters and addresses used across multiple contracts within the ecosystem, enabling coordinated and consistent behavior throughout the protocol.
