# IGyroConfig

The `IGyroConfig` interface is a critical component of the Gyroscope protocol, as it is responsible for storing and managing the global configuration settings. This contract serves as the central authority for defining and controlling various parameters that govern the behavior of the entire system.

The `IGyroConfig` interface provides a set of functions that allow for the retrieval, modification, and freezing of configuration values. This includes the ability to set and retrieve both *uint256* and *address* values, as well as the ability to unset and freeze specific configuration keys.

One of the key features of `IGyroConfig` is its event emitting capabilities. Whenever a configuration is changed, either by setting a new value or unsetting an existing one, the contract emits events to notify the rest of the protocol. This allows other components to react to these changes and adapt their behavior accordingly.

<Callout type="info">
The ability to freeze a configuration key is an important security feature, as it prevents the value from being changed or unset, even by the governor. This is crucial for ensuring the stability and predictability of the Gyroscope protocol.
</Callout>

The `IGyroConfig` interface also provides a function to list all the registered configuration keys, which can be useful for auditing and debugging purposes.

## Retrieving Configuration Values

Gyroscope developers can use the `getUint()` and `getAddress()` functions to retrieve the values of specific configuration keys. These functions take the key as an argument and return the corresponding value. If the key does not exist, the `getUint()` function can return a default value, while the `getAddress()` function will return the zero address.

```solidity
bytes32 key = keccak256("ALPHA_BAR");
uint256 alphaBar = gyroConfig.getUint(key);
```

## Setting Configuration Values

Updating the configuration is a privileged operation, and can only be performed by the current governor of the Gyroscope protocol. Developers can use the `setUint()` and `setAddress()` functions to update the values of specific configuration keys.

<Steps>
### Step 1
Obtain the necessary permissions to update the configuration. This typically involves being the current governor or being authorized by the governor.

### Step 2
Determine the configuration key you wish to update and the new value you want to set.

### Step 3
Call the appropriate `setUint()` or `setAddress()` function on the `IGyroConfig` contract, passing in the key and the new value.
</Steps>

```solidity
bytes32 key = keccak256("ALPHA_BAR");
uint256 newAlphaBar = 0.5e18;
gyroConfig.setUint(key, newAlphaBar);
```

## Unsetting and Freezing Configuration Keys

In addition to setting new values, the `IGyroConfig` interface also provides the ability to unset and freeze configuration keys. Unsetting a key removes it from the configuration, while freezing a key makes it impossible to update or unset in the future.

<Steps>
### Step 1
Obtain the necessary permissions to unset or freeze a configuration key. This typically involves being the current governor or being authorized by the governor.

### Step 2
Determine the configuration key you wish to unset or freeze.

### Step 3
Call the `unset()` function to remove the key from the configuration, or the `freeze()` function to make the key immutable.
</Steps>

```solidity
bytes32 key = keccak256("ALPHA_BAR");
gyroConfig.unset(key);
gyroConfig.freeze(key);
```

By providing this level of control and configurability, the `IGyroConfig` interface allows the Gyroscope protocol to be highly adaptable and responsive to changing market conditions and governance decisions. Developers building on top of Gyroscope can rely on this interface to interact with the protocol's global settings and ensure their applications are in sync with the overall system.
