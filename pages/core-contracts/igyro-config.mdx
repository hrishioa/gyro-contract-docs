# IGyroConfig

The `IGyroConfig` contract is the central point for managing the global configuration of the Gyroscope protocol. It allows the protocol governor to set and update various parameters that are used throughout the system.

## Key Responsibilities

The main responsibilities of the `IGyroConfig` contract are:

1. **Storing and Retrieving Configuration Values**: The contract provides functions to set, retrieve, and unset configuration values identified by unique keys.
2. **Configuration Freezing**: Selected configuration values can be "frozen" to prevent them from being modified in the future, ensuring the integrity of critical parameters.
3. **Governance Control**: All configuration updates are subject to governance control, ensuring that changes are approved by the protocol's decision-makers.

## Configuration Management

The `IGyroConfig` contract uses a key-value store to manage the protocol's configuration. Each configuration parameter is identified by a unique `bytes32` key, and its value can be either a `uint256` or an `address`. The contract also stores metadata about each configuration parameter, including whether it is frozen and its data type.

<Callout type="info">
  The use of `bytes32` keys allows for efficient storage and lookup of
  configuration parameters, while the metadata provides additional context about
  each setting.
</Callout>

### Setting and Retrieving Configuration Values

The `IGyroConfig` contract provides the following functions for managing configuration values:

- `setUint(bytes32 key, uint256 newValue)`: Sets a `uint256` configuration value for the given key.
- `setAddress(bytes32 key, address newValue)`: Sets an `address` configuration value for the given key.
- `getUint(bytes32 key)`: Retrieves the `uint256` value for the given key.
- `getAddress(bytes32 key)`: Retrieves the `address` value for the given key.
- `unset(bytes32 key)`: Removes the configuration value for the given key.

### Freezing Configuration Values

To ensure the stability and integrity of critical protocol parameters, the `IGyroConfig` contract allows the governor to "freeze" configuration values, making them immutable. This is done using the `freeze(bytes32 key)` function.

<Callout type="warning">
  Once a configuration value is frozen, it cannot be updated or unset, ensuring
  that the parameter remains fixed for the lifetime of the protocol.
</Callout>

### Governance Control

All configuration updates in the `IGyroConfig` contract are subject to governance control. This means that only the current governor, as defined by the `IGovernable` interface, can make changes to the protocol's configuration.

The `governanceOnly` modifier is used to restrict access to the configuration management functions, ensuring that only the governor can interact with the contract.

## Events and Monitoring

The `IGyroConfig` contract emits several events to notify external parties of changes to the protocol's configuration:

- `ConfigChanged(bytes32 key, uint256 previousValue, uint256 newValue)`: Emitted when a `uint256` configuration value is changed.
- `ConfigChanged(bytes32 key, address previousValue, address newValue)`: Emitted when an `address` configuration value is changed.
- `ConfigUnset(bytes32 key)`: Emitted when a configuration value is unset.
- `ConfigFrozen(bytes32 key)`: Emitted when a configuration value is frozen.

By monitoring these events, external systems and tools can stay up-to-date with the protocol's configuration and ensure that changes are in line with the expected governance processes.

## Example Usage

Suppose we want to update the `xuBar` parameter, which is a key configuration value used by the primary AMM pricing contract (`PAMM`). We can do this as follows:

<Steps>
### Step 1
First, we need to determine the `bytes32` key for the `xuBar` parameter. This can be done by hashing the parameter name using Keccak-256:

```solidity
bytes32 xuBarKey = keccak256(abi.encodePacked("xuBar"));
```

### Step 2

Next, we can use the `setUint` function to update the `xuBar` value:

```solidity
gyroConfig.setUint(xuBarKey, 0.8e18);
```

Here, we're setting the `xuBar` parameter to 0.8, which is represented as 0.8 \* 10^18 in the contract's fixed-point representation.

### Step 3

We can also retrieve the current value of `xuBar` using the `getUint` function:

```solidity
uint256 currentXuBar = gyroConfig.getUint(xuBarKey);
```

This allows us to check the current configuration and ensure that the update was successful.

</Steps>

By using the `IGyroConfig` contract, protocol developers can easily manage the global configuration of the Gyroscope system, ensuring that critical parameters are properly governed and that changes can be easily monitored.
