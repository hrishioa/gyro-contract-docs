# IMotherboard

The `IMotherboard` is the central contract that connects the different components of the Gyroscope protocol. It acts as the main entry point for users to interact with the protocol, handling the minting and redemption of the Gyro Dollar (GYD) token.

The `IMotherboard` contract provides the following key functionalities:

## Minting GYD Tokens

The `mint` function allows users to deposit various tokens into the protocol and receive GYD tokens in return. This function takes an array of `MintAsset` structs, which specify the input tokens, their amounts, and the destination vaults for the deposits.

<Callout type="info">
The `MintAsset` struct contains the following fields:
- `inputToken`: The address of the input token
- `inputAmount`: The amount of the input token to deposit
- `destinationVault`: The address of the vault where the input token should be deposited
</Callout>

The `IMotherboard` contract ensures that the minting process is secure and conforms to the protocol's safety checks by calling the `checkAndPersistMint` function on the `ISafetyCheck` contract.

## Redeeming GYD Tokens

The `redeem` function allows users to burn GYD tokens and receive the underlying tokens in return. This function takes an array of `RedeemAsset` structs, which specify the output tokens, the minimum amounts to receive, and the origin vaults from which the tokens should be withdrawn.

<Callout type="info">
The `RedeemAsset` struct contains the following fields:
- `outputToken`: The address of the output token
- `minOutputAmount`: The minimum amount of the output token to receive
- `valueRatio`: The ratio of the output token value to the redeemed GYD amount
- `originVault`: The address of the vault from which the output token should be withdrawn
</Callout>

Similar to the minting process, the `IMotherboard` contract ensures the safety of the redemption by calling the `checkAndPersistRedeem` function on the `ISafetyCheck` contract.

## Dry-Run Functions

The `IMotherboard` contract also provides "dry-run" versions of the `mint` and `redeem` functions, namely `dryMint` and `dryRedeem`. These functions simulate the respective operations without actually executing them, returning the expected results and any potential error messages.

This allows users to preview the outcome of a mint or redeem operation before committing to it, helping them make more informed decisions and avoid unexpected outcomes.

## Integration with Other Gyroscope Components

The `IMotherboard` contract integrates with several other key components of the Gyroscope protocol, including:

- [IGyroConfig](/igyro-config): Provides access to the global configuration settings.
- [IReserve](/ireserve): Manages the token deposits and withdrawals for the protocol.
- [IPAMM](/ipamm): Interacts with the primary AMM pricing mechanism.
- [IGYDToken](/section-permalink/igyd-token): Handles the minting and burning of the Gyro Dollar (GYD) token.
- [ISafetyCheck](/isafety-check): Performs safety checks on mint and redeem operations.

These integrations allow the `IMotherboard` to coordinate the different parts of the Gyroscope protocol and ensure the overall system functions as intended.

By acting as the central hub for user interactions, the `IMotherboard` contract simplifies the user experience and abstracts away the complexity of the underlying protocol components. This makes the Gyroscope protocol more accessible and user-friendly for developers and end-users alike.
