# IMotherboard

The **IMotherboard** contract is the central hub that connects the different components of the Gyroscope protocol. It serves as the main interface for users to interact with the protocol, providing functions for minting and redeeming Gyro Dollars (GYD).

The IMotherboard interface defines the following key functionalities:

## Accessing Protocol Components

The IMotherboard contract provides getter methods to retrieve the addresses of the core protocol components:

- `gydToken()`: Returns the address of the GYD token contract.
- `pamm()`: Returns the address of the Primary AMM (PAMM) contract.
- `reserve()`: Returns the address of the Reserve contract.
- `gyroConfig()`: Returns the address of the Gyro Config contract.

This allows other contracts and applications to easily interact with these components without needing to know their specific addresses.

## Minting GYD

The `mint()` function allows users to mint GYD tokens by providing a list of `DataTypes.MintAsset` structs. Each struct contains the input token address, the input amount, and the destination vault address.

<Callout type="info">
The `MintAsset` struct is defined as follows:

```solidity
struct MintAsset {
    address inputToken;
    uint256 inputAmount;
    address destinationVault;
}
```
</Callout>

The Motherboard contract will then take care of depositing the input tokens into the respective vaults, calculating the amount of GYD to mint, and minting them for the user. The function returns the actual amount of GYD minted.

<Steps>
### Step 1
The user calls the `mint()` function on the Motherboard contract, providing an array of `MintAsset` structs.

### Step 2
The Motherboard contract verifies the input data and performs the following steps:
1. Deposits the input tokens into the specified vaults.
2. Calculates the amount of GYD to mint based on the PAMM contract's logic.
3. Mints the GYD tokens and sends them to the user.

### Step 3
The Motherboard contract returns the actual amount of GYD minted.
</Steps>

## Redeeming GYD

The `redeem()` function allows users to redeem GYD tokens in exchange for the underlying assets. The user provides the amount of GYD to redeem and an array of `DataTypes.RedeemAsset` structs, which specify the output token addresses, minimum output amounts, and the origin vault addresses.

<Callout type="info">
The `RedeemAsset` struct is defined as follows:

```solidity
struct RedeemAsset {
    address outputToken;
    uint256 minOutputAmount;
    uint256 valueRatio;
    address originVault;
}
```
</Callout>

The Motherboard contract will then calculate the output amounts, withdraw the tokens from the respective vaults, and transfer them to the user. The function returns the actual output amounts.

<Steps>
### Step 1
The user calls the `redeem()` function on the Motherboard contract, providing the amount of GYD to redeem and an array of `RedeemAsset` structs.

### Step 2
The Motherboard contract verifies the input data and performs the following steps:
1. Calculates the output amounts based on the PAMM contract's logic.
2. Withdraws the output tokens from the specified vaults.
3. Transfers the output tokens to the user.

### Step 3
The Motherboard contract returns the actual output amounts.
</Steps>

## Dry Run Functions

The Motherboard contract also provides two "dry run" functions, `dryMint()` and `dryRedeem()`, which allow users to simulate the mint and redeem operations without actually executing them. These functions return the expected output amounts and any error messages that would occur if the actual operation were to be performed.

These dry run functions are useful for users to estimate the expected outcome of their actions before committing to them, helping them to manage slippage and avoid unexpected results.

## Integrating with Other Components

The IMotherboard contract serves as the primary entry point for interacting with the Gyroscope protocol. It integrates with other key components, such as the PAMM, Reserve, and GYD token, to provide a seamless user experience.

For example, when a user calls the `mint()` function, the Motherboard contract coordinates the deposit of input tokens into the vaults, the calculation of the GYD amount to mint, and the actual minting of the GYD tokens. This abstraction allows users to interact with the protocol without needing to understand the low-level details of each component.

Overall, the IMotherboard contract is the central hub that enables users to easily mint and redeem GYD tokens, while hiding the complexity of the underlying protocol architecture.
