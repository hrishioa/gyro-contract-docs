# IReserve

The `IReserve` interface is responsible for managing the token deposits and withdrawals in the Gyroscope protocol. This contract serves as the central repository for all the tokens that are part of the Gyroscope reserve.

The key features of the `IReserve` contract include:

1. **Deposit and Withdraw Tokens**: The contract allows authorized managers to deposit and withdraw tokens from the reserve. This is an essential functionality as it enables the minting and redemption of Gyro Dollars (GYD) by interacting with the vaults.

2. **Manage Authorized Managers**: The contract maintains a list of authorized managers who are allowed to interact with the reserve. This access control mechanism ensures that only trusted entities can deposit and withdraw tokens.

3. **Emit Events**: The contract emits events whenever tokens are deposited or withdrawn, as well as when managers are added or removed. This provides transparency and allows other components of the Gyroscope protocol to track changes to the reserve.

Let's dive into the key functions and events of the `IReserve` interface:

## Functions

### `managers()`
This function returns the list of authorized managers who can deposit and withdraw tokens from the reserve.

<Callout type="info">
The authorized managers are expected to be trusted entities, such as the Motherboard contract, that are responsible for minting and redeeming Gyro Dollars (GYD).
</Callout>

### `addManager(address manager)`
This function adds a new manager to the list of authorized managers. Only the current managers can call this function.

### `removeManager(address manager)`
This function removes a manager from the list of authorized managers. Only the current managers can call this function.

### `depositToken(address token, uint256 amount)`
This function allows an authorized manager to deposit a specified amount of a token into the reserve.

<Callout type="info">
The tokens deposited into the reserve are used to back the Gyro Dollars (GYD) during the minting process. The reserve serves as the primary source of liquidity for the protocol.
</Callout>

### `withdrawToken(address token, uint256 amount)`
This function allows an authorized manager to withdraw a specified amount of a token from the reserve. This is typically done during the redemption process, where Gyro Dollars (GYD) are burned in exchange for the underlying tokens.

## Events

### `ManagerAdded(address indexed manager)`
This event is emitted whenever a new manager is added to the reserve.

### `ManagerRemoved(address indexed manager)`
This event is emitted whenever a manager is removed from the reserve.

### `Deposit(address indexed from, address indexed token, uint256 amount)`
This event is emitted whenever a token is deposited into the reserve.

### `Withdraw(address indexed from, address indexed token, uint256 amount)`
This event is emitted whenever a token is withdrawn from the reserve.

The `IReserve` contract plays a crucial role in the Gyroscope protocol, serving as the central repository for all the tokens that back the Gyro Dollars (GYD). By managing the authorized managers and providing deposit and withdrawal functionalities, the `IReserve` ensures the integrity and liquidity of the Gyroscope ecosystem.
