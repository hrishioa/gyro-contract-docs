# High-Level Architecture

The Gyroscope protocol is designed with a modular architecture, allowing for flexibility, extensibility, and upgradability. The core components of the protocol include the **Primary Automated Market Maker (PAMM)**, the **Reserve**, the **Motherboard**, and various **Oracles**.

The **PAMM** is the primary pricing mechanism for the Gyroscope protocol. It is responsible for determining the price of the GYD token based on the reserve value and the redemption level. The PAMM uses a set of configurable parameters to calculate the reserve value and the amount of GYD tokens to mint or redeem.

The **Reserve** is the contract that holds the assets deposited into the Gyroscope protocol. It manages the deposits and withdrawals of these assets, and provides access to the asset balances.

The **Motherboard** is the central contract that connects the various components of the Gyroscope protocol. It is responsible for handling the minting and redemption of GYD tokens, and for coordinating the interactions between the different contracts.

The **Oracles** are responsible for providing the necessary price information to the PAMM and other components of the protocol. The Gyroscope protocol uses a combination of [oracles](/oracles) to obtain accurate and reliable price data.

The **GYD Token** is the stablecoin issued by the Gyroscope protocol. It is backed by the assets held in the Reserve, and its price is determined by the PAMM.

The **Fee Bank** is the contract that holds the protocol fees collected from various operations, such as minting and redemption.

The **Vault Registry** is responsible for managing the registration and deregistration of vaults in the Gyroscope protocol.

The **Vault Weight Manager** is responsible for managing the weights of the vaults in the Reserve.

The **Reserve Safety Manager** is responsible for checking the safety of mint and redeem operations, ensuring that they do not introduce unacceptable risks to the protocol.

The **Asset Registry** is responsible for managing the registration and deregistration of assets in the Gyroscope protocol.

The **Cap Authentication** is responsible for managing the authentication of accounts that are subject to a supply cap.

This modular architecture allows the Gyroscope protocol to be easily extended and upgraded over time, as new components can be added or existing ones can be modified without disrupting the overall system.
