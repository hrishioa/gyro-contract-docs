# Core Contracts

The Gyroscope protocol is built upon a set of core contracts that handle the fundamental functionality of the system. These contracts are responsible for managing the primary AMM pricing mechanism, the reserve of vaults, the global configuration, and the safety checks for minting and redemption operations.

Let's dive into the key contracts in the Gyroscope protocol:

## PAMM (PrimaryAMMV1)
The [PAMM](/core-contracts/pamm) contract implements the primary AMM pricing mechanism for the Gyroscope protocol. It is responsible for computing the amount of GYD tokens to mint or redeem based on the current state of the reserve. This contract uses sophisticated mathematical models to ensure the stability and sustainability of the Gyroscope stablecoin.

## IPAMM
The [IPAMM](/core-contracts/ipamm) interface defines the public API for interacting with the primary AMM pricing mechanism. It allows users and other contracts to query the minting and redemption amounts, as well as to update the system parameters.

## IGyroConfig
The [IGyroConfig](/core-contracts/igyro-config) interface is responsible for storing and managing the global configuration settings of the Gyroscope protocol. This includes parameters like fee rates, oracle addresses, and other critical system settings. The configuration can be updated through governance.

<Callout type="info">
The configuration is stored in a separate contract to ensure that it can be easily updated without the need to redeploy the entire protocol.

## IGyroVault
The [IGyroVault](/core-contracts/igyro-vault) interface defines the functionality for a vault component in the Gyroscope reserve. Vaults are responsible for holding the underlying tokens that back the GYD stablecoin. They provide methods for depositing, withdrawing, and managing the tokens in the vault.

## IMotherboard
The [IMotherboard](/core-contracts/imotherboard) interface is the central contract that connects the different pieces of the Gyroscope protocol. It provides the main entry points for minting and redeeming GYD tokens, and coordinates the interactions between the various core contracts.

## IReserve
The [IReserve](/core-contracts/ireserve) interface defines the functionality for the reserve contract, which manages the deposits and withdrawals of tokens in the Gyroscope protocol. It allows authorized managers to deposit and withdraw tokens from the reserve, and emits events for these actions.

## ISafetyCheck
The [ISafetyCheck](/core-contracts/isafety-check) interface specifies the safety checks that must be performed before a minting or redemption operation can be executed. These checks ensure that the proposed changes to the reserve are safe and do not compromise the stability of the Gyroscope stablecoin.

By understanding the roles and interactions of these core contracts, developers can build a comprehensive understanding of the Gyroscope protocol and its inner workings. This knowledge will be crucial for building applications and integrating with the Gyroscope ecosystem.
