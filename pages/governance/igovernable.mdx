# IGovernable

The `IGovernable` interface provides the standard mechanism for managing the governor of a contract in the Gyroscope protocol. The governor is the privileged address that can perform certain administrative actions, such as updating system parameters or authorizing new components.

The `IGovernable` interface defines the following key functions:

## `governor()` and `pendingGovernor()`

These functions allow you to retrieve the current governor and the pending governor (the address that has been nominated to become the new governor, but has not yet accepted the role).

```solidity
/// @notice Returns the current governor
function governor() external view returns (address);

/// @notice Returns the pending governor
function pendingGovernor() external view returns (address);
```

## `changeGovernor()`

This function allows the current governor to nominate a new governor. The nominated address becomes the "pending governor" and must call `acceptGovernance()` to officially become the new governor.

```solidity
/// @notice Changes the governor of the contract
/// @param newGovernor the address of the new governor
function changeGovernor(address newGovernor) external;
```

<Callout type="info">
It's important to note that the new governor must be a non-zero address. Attempting to set the governor to the zero address will result in an error.
</Callout>

## `acceptGovernance()`

The pending governor must call this function to officially become the new governor. This function will emit an `GovernorChanged` event to notify the rest of the system about the change in governance.

```solidity
/// @notice Called by the pending governor to approve the change
function acceptGovernance() external;
```

<Callout type="warning">
Only the pending governor can call the `acceptGovernance()` function. Attempting to call it from any other address will result in an error.
</Callout>

The `IGovernable` interface is a crucial part of the Gyroscope protocol's governance model, as it allows the protocol to be updated and maintained over time by the community. By separating the governor role from the contract implementation, the protocol can be upgraded without requiring a full redeployment, making it more flexible and adaptable to changing requirements.
