# IGovernable

The `IGovernable` interface is a crucial component of the Gyroscope protocol, as it provides the foundation for **governance** and **access control** across the various contracts within the system.

In the Gyroscope protocol, several critical functions and configurations are **protected** and can only be modified by authorized entities, such as the **governor**. The `IGovernable` interface defines the standard for how this governance system should be implemented, ensuring consistency and security across the codebase.

<Callout type="info">
The governor is a special account that has the authority to perform certain privileged actions, such as updating system parameters or changing the protocol's configuration.
</Callout>

The `IGovernable` interface defines the following key features:

## Governor Management

- **Changing the Governor**: The `changeGovernor` function allows the current governor to transfer governance to a new address.
- **Accepting Governance**: The `acceptGovernance` function allows a pending governor to officially assume the governance role.

## Governance Events

The `IGovernable` interface also defines two important events that are emitted when the governor is changed:

- `GovernorChanged`: Emitted when the governor is changed.
- `GovernorChangeRequested`: Emitted when a change in the governor is requested.

These events are crucial for **monitoring** and **auditing** the protocol's governance changes.

## Usage in the Gyroscope Protocol

The `IGovernable` interface is implemented by several key contracts in the Gyroscope protocol, including:

- [PrimaryAMMV1](/pamm): The primary AMM pricing mechanism
- [IGyroConfig](/igyro-config): The global configuration management contract
- [ReserveSafetyManager](/isafety-check): The contract responsible for checking the safety of mint and redeem operations

By using the `IGovernable` interface, these contracts ensure that any changes to their critical functionality can only be made by the authorized governor, maintaining the overall security and integrity of the Gyroscope protocol.
