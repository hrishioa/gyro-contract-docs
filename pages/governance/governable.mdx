# Governable

The `Governable` contract is a base contract in the Gyroscope protocol that provides a basic access control mechanism for governing the protocol. It allows an account, known as the governor, to be granted exclusive access to specific functions.

By default, the governor account is the one that deploys the `Governable` contract. This can later be changed using the `changeGovernor` function, which is only accessible to the current governor.

The `Governable` contract provides the following key features:

## Governor Management

- The `governor` function returns the current governor address.
- The `pendingGovernor` function returns the address of the pending governor, if a governor change is in progress.
- The `changeGovernor` function allows the current governor to request a change to a new governor address. The new governor must then call the `acceptGovernance` function to complete the change.
- The `acceptGovernance` function can only be called by the pending governor to finalize the governor change.

## Access Control

The `Governable` contract uses a `governanceOnly` modifier to restrict access to certain functions to only the current governor. This ensures that only the governor can perform privileged actions, such as updating system parameters or managing the protocol configuration.

```solidity
modifier governanceOnly() {
    require(msg.sender == governor, Errors.NOT_AUTHORIZED);
    _;
}
```

This modifier is used throughout the Gyroscope protocol to protect sensitive functions and maintain the integrity of the system.

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how the `Governable` contract might be used in the Gyroscope protocol:

```solidity
import "Governable.sol";

contract PrimaryAMMV1 is IPAMM, Governable {
    constructor(address _governor, /* other params */) Governable(_governor) {
        // ...
    }

    function setSystemParams(Params memory params) external governanceOnly {
        // Update the system parameters, which can only be called by the governor
        systemParams = params;
        emit SystemParamsUpdated(/* ... */);
    }

    // Other functions that are protected by the governanceOnly modifier
}
```

In this example, the `PrimaryAMMV1` contract inherits from the `Governable` contract and uses the `governanceOnly` modifier to protect the `setSystemParams` function. This ensures that only the governor can update the system parameters, which is a critical function for the overall health and stability of the Gyroscope protocol.

The `Governable` contract is a fundamental building block of the Gyroscope protocol, providing a secure and flexible governance model that allows the protocol to be managed and updated over time by the community.
