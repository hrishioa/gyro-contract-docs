# Governable

The `Governable` contract is the base contract that provides the functionality for governor management in the Gyroscope protocol. It is a key component of the protocol's governance system, which allows the community to make important decisions and updates to the system.

The `Governable` contract is responsible for the following:

- Storing the address of the current governor
- Allowing the current governor to change the governor
- Emitting events when the governor is changed

## Governor Management

The governor of the Gyroscope protocol is the entity that has the authority to make important decisions and updates to the system. This could be a multi-sig wallet, a DAO, or any other appropriate governance structure.

The `Governable` contract provides the following functionality for managing the governor:

### Changing the Governor

The current governor can change the governor by calling the `changeGovernor` function. This function takes the address of the new governor as a parameter and emits a `GovernorChangeRequested` event.

<Callout type="info">
The new governor must accept the governance by calling the `acceptGovernance` function before the change takes effect.
</Allout>

### Accepting Governance

The new governor can accept the governance by calling the `acceptGovernance` function. This function transfers the governance to the new governor and emits a `GovernorChanged` event.

### Checking the Governor

The current governor can be retrieved by calling the `governor` function, and the pending governor can be retrieved by calling the `pendingGovernor` function.

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how the `Governable` contract can be used in the Gyroscope protocol:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: LicenseRef-Gyro-1.0
pragma solidity ^0.8.4;

import "Governable.sol";

contract PrimaryAMMV1 is Governable {
    // ...

    constructor(address _governor, /* other parameters */) Governable(_governor) {
        // ...
    }

    function setSystemParams(Params memory params) external governanceOnly {
        // ...
    }

    // ...
}
```

In this example, the `PrimaryAMMV1` contract inherits from the `Governable` contract and uses the `governanceOnly` modifier to ensure that only the governor can call certain functions, such as `setSystemParams`.

The `Governable` contract provides a solid foundation for managing the governance of the Gyroscope protocol, ensuring that important decisions are made by the authorized entity.
