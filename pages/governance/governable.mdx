# Governable

The `Governable` contract is a base contract that provides functionality for managing a governor address, which is responsible for making administrative decisions for the Gyroscope protocol. This contract is used as a building block for other contracts in the Gyroscope ecosystem, ensuring consistent governance mechanisms across the protocol.

## Governor Management

The `Governable` contract allows for the management of the governor address through two key functions:

1. **Changing the Governor**: The `changeGovernor` function allows the current governor to update the governor address to a new one. This is an important governance function, as the governor is responsible for making critical decisions that impact the protocol.

2. **Accepting Governance**: The `acceptGovernance` function allows a pending governor to officially take over the governor role. This two-step process (changing and accepting) helps ensure a smooth transition of governance responsibilities.

These functions are protected by the `governanceOnly` modifier, which restricts their access to only the current governor.

<Callout type="info">
The initial governor is set during the `Governable` contract's construction, and subsequent changes are made through the `changeGovernor` and `acceptGovernance` functions.
</Callout>

## Events

The `Governable` contract emits two events to keep track of governor changes:

1. **GovernorChanged**: This event is emitted whenever the governor is changed, and it includes the old and new governor addresses.
2. **GovernorChangeRequested**: This event is emitted whenever a governor change is requested, and it includes the proposed new governor address.

These events can be useful for off-chain monitoring and tracking of governance activities.

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how the `Governable` contract might be used in the context of the Gyroscope protocol:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: LicenseRef-Gyro-1.0
pragma solidity ^0.8.4;

import "Governable.sol";

contract PrimaryAMMV1 is Governable {
    constructor(address _governor, /* other parameters */) Governable(_governor) {
        // Initialize the primary AMM contract with the provided governor address
    }

    function setSystemParams(/* parameters */) external governanceOnly {
        // Update the system parameters, which can only be done by the governor
    }
}
```

In this example, the `PrimaryAMMV1` contract inherits from `Governable` and uses the governor address to control access to the `setSystemParams` function, which allows the governor to update the system parameters of the primary AMM.

By using the `Governable` contract as a base, the `PrimaryAMMV1` contract ensures that the governance mechanisms are consistently applied across the Gyroscope protocol, making it easier to maintain and update the governance rules over time.

## Conclusion

The `Governable` contract provides a standardized way to manage the governor address in the Gyroscope protocol. By encapsulating governor management in a reusable contract, the protocol can ensure consistent governance across its various components, making it easier to evolve and adapt the protocol's governance over time.
