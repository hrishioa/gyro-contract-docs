# Governance

The Gyroscope protocol relies on a governance system to manage key aspects of the protocol, such as configuration updates, contract upgrades, and other critical decisions. This governance system is implemented through the use of two key contracts: **Governable** and **IGovernable**.

The **Governable** contract provides the basic functionality for managing a governor, which is the account or contract that has the authority to make changes to the protocol. This contract allows the governor to be updated, and also provides a modifier to restrict access to certain functions to only the governor.

The **IGovernable** interface defines the standard methods for interacting with the governance system, including:

- `changeGovernor`: Allows the current governor to change the governor to a new address.
- `acceptGovernance`: Allows the pending governor to accept the governance role.
- `governor`: Returns the current governor address.
- `pendingGovernor`: Returns the pending governor address.

Here's an example of how the **Governable** contract is used in the Gyroscope protocol:

```solidity
contract Governable is GovernableBase {
    constructor(address _governor) {
        governor = _governor;
        emit GovernorChanged(address(0), _governor);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Governable` contract inherits from the `GovernableBase` contract, which implements the core functionality of the governor management system. The `constructor` sets the initial governor address and emits an event to notify the rest of the protocol.

<Callout type="info">
The `GovernableBase` contract is a separate contract that provides the low-level implementation of the governor management system. This separation of concerns helps to keep the `Governable` contract focused on its primary responsibility of managing the governor, while delegating the more complex implementation details to the `GovernableBase` contract.

The governance system in the Gyroscope protocol is designed to be secure and flexible, allowing the protocol to evolve over time while maintaining a high level of control and oversight. By using a centralized governor, the protocol can quickly respond to emerging threats or opportunities, while the double-approval process (current governor approving a new governor, then the new governor accepting the role) helps to ensure that governance changes are deliberate and well-considered.

Overall, the governance system is a critical component of the Gyroscope protocol, providing a robust and extensible framework for managing the protocol's evolution and ensuring the long-term success of the project.
