# CheckedPriceOracle

The **CheckedPriceOracle** is a key component in the Gyroscope protocol responsible for fetching and validating the prices of assets used in the system. It acts as a trusted price oracle, performing various checks to ensure the prices are accurate and consistent.

## Overview

The CheckedPriceOracle contract serves several important functions:

1. **Fetching Prices**: It retrieves the USD price of various assets from external price oracles, such as Chainlink.
2. **Price Validation**: It performs a series of checks on the fetched prices to ensure they are within acceptable bounds and consistent with each other.
3. **Relative Price Checks**: It verifies the relative prices between assets to detect any potential deviations from expected values.
4. **Trusted Price Sources**: It allows for the addition and removal of trusted price sources, whose prices are used to validate the overall price level.

By performing these checks, the CheckedPriceOracle helps to maintain the integrity and reliability of the asset prices used throughout the Gyroscope protocol.

## Price Fetching and Validation

The `getPricesUSDWithMetadata` function is the main entry point for fetching and validating asset prices. It takes an array of token addresses as input and returns the following information:

1. The USD prices for each token
2. The WETH/USD price level
3. The prices from trusted signed sources (e.g., Chainlink, Coinbase)
4. The time-weighted average prices (TWAPs) of the tokens paired with WETH

The WETH/USD price level is used as the "root" price, and the other prices are validated against this.
</Callout>

The price validation process involves several steps:

1. **Relative Price Consistency**: The function `_ensureRelativePriceConsistency` checks that the relative prices between assets are consistent with the USD prices fetched from the oracles.
2. **Root Price Grounding**: The `_checkPriceLevel` function ensures that the WETH/USD price level is "grounded" by comparing it to the prices from trusted signed sources.
3. **TWAP Checks**: The `batchRelativePriceCheck` function verifies that the TWAP prices of the tokens paired with WETH are consistent with the overall price level.

These checks help to detect any potential manipulation or stale prices, ensuring that the asset prices used in the Gyroscope protocol are reliable and accurate.

## Trusted Price Sources

The CheckedPriceOracle allows for the addition and removal of trusted price sources, such as Chainlink or Coinbase. These trusted sources are used to validate the overall price level, as their prices are considered to be the most reliable.

<Steps>
### Step 1: Add a Trusted Price Source

To add a new trusted price source, the governance contract can call the `addSignedPriceSource` function, passing the address of the new price oracle.

### Step 2: Remove a Trusted Price Source

To remove a trusted price source, the governance contract can call the `removeSignedPriceSource` function, passing the address of the price oracle to be removed.
</Steps>

By maintaining a list of trusted price sources, the CheckedPriceOracle can leverage multiple independent oracles to provide a robust and reliable price feed for the Gyroscope protocol.

## Configurable Parameters

The CheckedPriceOracle contract has several configurable parameters that can be adjusted by the governance contract:

- `MAX_ABSOLUTE_WETH_DEVIATION`: The maximum allowed deviation between the WETH/USD price level and the prices from trusted signed sources.
- `INITIAL_RELATIVE_EPSILON`: The initial maximum allowed relative deviation between asset prices and their expected values.
- `MAX_RELATIVE_EPSILON`: The maximum allowed relative epsilon value.

These parameters can be adjusted to fine-tune the price validation process and adapt to changing market conditions.

## Conclusion

The CheckedPriceOracle is a critical component of the Gyroscope protocol, responsible for fetching and validating the prices of assets used throughout the system. By performing various checks and leveraging trusted price sources, the CheckedPriceOracle helps to ensure the integrity and reliability of the asset prices, which is essential for the proper functioning of the Gyroscope protocol.
