# IUSDPriceOracle

The `IUSDPriceOracle` interface is a crucial component of the Gyroscope protocol, responsible for providing the USD prices of various assets. This oracle is designed to be a reliable and trusted source of price information, ensuring the accuracy and integrity of the protocol's operations.

## Quoting USD Prices

The primary function of the `IUSDPriceOracle` is to provide the USD price of a given asset, as demonstrated by the `getPriceUSD` function:

```solidity
/// @notice Quotes the USD price of `tokenAddress`
/// The quoted price is always scaled with 18 decimals regardless of the
/// source used for the oracle.
/// @param tokenAddress the asset of which the price is to be quoted
/// @return the USD price of the asset
function getPriceUSD(address tokenAddress) external view returns (uint256);
```

This function takes the address of the asset as input and returns the corresponding USD price, scaled to 18 decimal places. This ensures that the prices are consistent and can be easily compared, regardless of the underlying data source or the token's native decimal places.

> The `IUSDPriceOracle` abstracts away the complexities of fetching and processing the raw price data, providing a simple and reliable interface for the Gyroscope protocol to consume.

## Batch Price Fetching

In addition to individual price fetching, the `IUSDPriceOracle` also provides a batch price fetching mechanism through the `getPricesUSD` function:

```solidity
/// @notice Quotes the USD price of `baseAssets`
/// The quoted prices is always scaled with 18 decimals regardless of the
/// source used for the oracle.
/// @param baseAssets the assets of which the price is to be quoted
/// @return the USD prices of the asset
function getPricesUSD(address[] memory baseAssets) external view returns (uint256[] memory);
```

This function takes an array of asset addresses as input and returns an array of the corresponding USD prices. This is particularly useful when you need to fetch the prices of multiple assets at once, as it can reduce the number of contract calls and improve the overall efficiency of your application.

## Integrating with the Gyroscope Protocol

The `IUSDPriceOracle` is a key component of the Gyroscope protocol and is used in various parts of the system, such as:

- [PrimaryAMMV1](/pamm) - The primary AMM pricing mechanism uses the `IUSDPriceOracle` to determine the value of the assets in the reserve.
- [CheckedPriceOracle](/checked-price-oracle) - This oracle wraps the `IUSDPriceOracle` and performs additional checks to ensure the reliability of the prices.
- [IMotherboard](/imotherboard) - The central contract that connects the different components of the Gyroscope protocol, including the `IUSDPriceOracle`.

By integrating the `IUSDPriceOracle` into the core of the Gyroscope protocol, the developers have ensured that the system has access to accurate and trustworthy price information, which is essential for the proper functioning of the decentralized stablecoin and other protocol features.
