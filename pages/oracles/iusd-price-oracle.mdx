# IUSDPriceOracle

The `IUSDPriceOracle` interface is a crucial component of the Gyroscope protocol, responsible for providing **USD-denominated prices** for various assets. This interface ensures that the protocol can access consistent and reliable price information, which is essential for accurate valuation and pricing of the Gyro Dollar (GYD) token.

The primary function of the `IUSDPriceOracle` interface is to provide the **`getPriceUSD`** method, which takes an `address` parameter representing the asset and returns the corresponding **USD price**. This price is always **scaled with 18 decimals**, ensuring consistency across different asset types and sources.

<Callout type="info">
The `IUSDPriceOracle` interface is designed to be **flexible and extensible**, allowing the protocol to integrate with various price oracles, such as Chainlink, to obtain the necessary price data.
</Callout>

The `IUSDPriceOracle` interface is used throughout the Gyroscope protocol, including in the [PAMM (Primary AMM)](/core-contracts/pamm) and [Motherboard](/core-contracts/imotherboard) contracts, to ensure that the protocol's pricing and valuation mechanisms are accurate and reliable.

Here's an example of how the `IUSDPriceOracle` interface might be implemented:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: LicenseRef-Gyro-1.0
// for information on licensing please see the README in the GitHub repository <https://github.com/gyrostable/core-protocol>.
pragma solidity ^0.8.4;

interface IUSDPriceOracle {
    /// @notice Quotes the USD price of `tokenAddress`
    /// The quoted price is always scaled with 18 decimals regardless of the
    /// source used for the oracle.
    /// @param tokenAddress the asset of which the price is to be quoted
    /// @return the USD price of the asset
    function getPriceUSD(address tokenAddress) external view returns (uint256);
}
```

In this example, the `IUSDPriceOracle` interface defines a single function, `getPriceUSD`, which takes an `address` parameter representing the asset and returns the corresponding USD price as a `uint256` value. The comment above the function explains the purpose and expected behavior of the function.

The Gyroscope protocol relies on the `IUSDPriceOracle` interface to ensure that the valuation and pricing mechanisms used throughout the protocol are accurate and reliable. By abstracting the price oracle functionality behind this interface, the protocol can easily adapt to changes in the underlying price data sources, ensuring the long-term sustainability and resilience of the Gyroscope ecosystem.
