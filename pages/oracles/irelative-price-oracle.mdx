# IRelativePriceOracle

The **IRelativePriceOracle** interface is a crucial component of the Gyroscope protocol, responsible for providing relative price information between different assets. This interface allows the Gyroscope protocol to perform necessary price checks and calculations to ensure the stability and security of the system.

The primary function of the **IRelativePriceOracle** is to quote the price of one asset (the "base token") relative to another asset (the "quote token"). This relative price is scaled with 18 decimals, ensuring consistent pricing across the protocol.

<Callout type="info">
The relative price of an asset is the number of units of the quote token per unit of the base token. For example, if the relative price of ETH/USDC is 2000, it means that 1 ETH is worth 2000 USDC.
</Callout>

The interface also provides a function to check whether a specific pair of assets is supported by the relative price oracle. This allows the protocol to handle unsupported pairs gracefully, without causing issues during operations.

## Functions

The **IRelativePriceOracle** interface defines the following functions:

### `getRelativePrice(address baseToken, address quoteToken) external view returns (uint256)`

This function returns the relative price of the `baseToken` denominated in the `quoteToken`. The returned price is scaled with 18 decimals.

**Example:**
```solidity
uint256 ethUsdcRelativePrice = relativeOracle.getRelativePrice(address(WETH), address(USDC));
// ethUsdcRelativePrice might be 2000, meaning 1 ETH = 2000 USDC
```

### `isPairSupported(address baseToken, address quoteToken) external view returns (bool)`

This function returns a boolean indicating whether the relative price oracle supports the provided `baseToken` and `quoteToken` pair.

**Example:**
```solidity
bool isEthUsdcSupported = relativeOracle.isPairSupported(address(WETH), address(USDC));
// isEthUsdcSupported should be true
```

## Usage in the Gyroscope Protocol

The **IRelativePriceOracle** interface is used extensively throughout the Gyroscope protocol, particularly in the [CheckedPriceOracle](/oracles/checked-price-oracle) contract. The **CheckedPriceOracle** uses the relative price information to perform various checks on the asset prices, ensuring that the protocol remains stable and secure.

For example, the **CheckedPriceOracle** uses the relative price information to:

1. **Ensure Relative Price Consistency**: The oracle checks that the relative price of an asset, as calculated from its USD price, is consistent with the directly queried relative price. This helps detect stale or manipulated prices.
2. **Compute Robust WETH Price**: The oracle computes a robust estimate of the WETH price by combining the relative price information with signed prices from trusted oracles.

By integrating the **IRelativePriceOracle** interface, the Gyroscope protocol can leverage accurate and reliable relative price data, enabling it to function safely and effectively.
