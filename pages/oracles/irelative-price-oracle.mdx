# IRelativePriceOracle

The `IRelativePriceOracle` interface is a crucial component of the Gyroscope protocol's oracle system. It provides a standardized way for fetching the relative price between two assets. This relative price information is essential for the [PAMM](/core-contracts/pamm) contract to accurately compute the reserve value of the protocol.

The interface defines a single function, `getRelativePrice`, which takes two token addresses as input and returns the relative price between them. The relative price is always scaled to 18 decimal places, regardless of the source used for the oracle.

```solidity
interface IRelativePriceOracle {
    /// @notice Quotes the price of `baseToken` relative to `quoteToken`
    /// The quoted price is always scaled with 18 decimals regardless of the
    /// source used for the oracle.
    /// @param baseToken the token of which the price is to be quoted
    /// @param quoteToken the token used to denominate the price
    /// @return the number of units of quote token per base token
    function getRelativePrice(address baseToken, address quoteToken)
        external
        view
        returns (uint256);

    /// @notice Returns whether the oracle currently supports prices
    /// for `baseToken` relative to `quoteToken`
    function isPairSupported(address baseToken, address quoteToken) external view returns (bool);
}
```

Callout:
> The relative price is the number of units of the quote token that are equivalent to one unit of the base token. For example, if the relative price of DAI to USDC is 1.01, it means that 1 DAI is worth 1.01 USDC.

The `IRelativePriceOracle` interface also includes a `isPairSupported` function, which allows clients to check whether the oracle supports fetching the relative price for a given pair of tokens. This is useful for handling scenarios where the oracle may not have data available for certain token pairs.

<Steps>
### Step 1
The `getRelativePrice` function is used to fetch the relative price between two tokens. It takes the addresses of the base token and the quote token as input, and returns the relative price as a `uint256` value scaled to 18 decimal places.

### Step 2
The `isPairSupported` function can be used to check whether the oracle supports fetching the relative price for a given pair of tokens. This is important for handling edge cases where the oracle may not have data available for certain token pairs.
</Steps>

The `IRelativePriceOracle` interface is a crucial component of the Gyroscope protocol, as it provides the necessary relative price information for the [PAMM](/core-contracts/pamm) contract to accurately compute the reserve value. By using this standardized interface, the Gyroscope protocol can easily integrate with different price oracle implementations, allowing for flexibility and extensibility in the overall system.
