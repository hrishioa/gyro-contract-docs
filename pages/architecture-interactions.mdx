# Architecture and Interactions

The Gyroscope protocol is a decentralized stablecoin system built on Ethereum. At a high level, it consists of several key components that work together to maintain the peg and stability of the Gyro Dollar (GYD) token. In this section, we'll explore the overall architecture of the protocol and the key interactions between its components.

The Gyroscope protocol is designed with a modular architecture, allowing for easier maintenance, upgrades, and extensibility. The main components include:

- **PAMM (Primary AMM)**: The core pricing mechanism that determines the value of the GYD token.
- **Reserve**: The contract that manages the reserve of underlying assets that back the GYD token.
- **Vaults**: The contracts that represent individual pools of liquidity within the reserve.
- **Motherboard**: The central contract that coordinates the interactions between the various components.
- **Oracles**: The price feeds that provide the necessary price information for the protocol.
- **Governance**: The mechanisms and contracts that enable protocol-level decision-making.

These components work together to provide the functionality and stability of the Gyroscope protocol. Let's dive into how they interact with each other.

## Minting and Redemption

The primary user-facing actions in the Gyroscope protocol are minting and redeeming GYD tokens. These operations involve interactions between several of the protocol's components.

## Oracle Integration

The Gyroscope protocol relies on a set of oracles to provide accurate and up-to-date price information for the assets in the reserve. This price data is crucial for the PAMM to correctly determine the value of the GYD token.

The architecture of the Gyroscope protocol is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for easy integration of new components and upgrades to existing ones. This provides the flexibility to adapt to changing market conditions and user needs over time.

By understanding the high-level architecture and the key interactions between the protocol's components, developers can gain a better understanding of how the Gyroscope system works and how to build applications and integrations on top of it.
