# Introduction

The Gyroscope protocol is a decentralized stablecoin ecosystem built on the Ethereum blockchain. It aims to provide a stable, scalable, and efficient medium of exchange for the DeFi ecosystem.

At the core of the Gyroscope protocol is the **Primary Automated Market Maker (PAMM)**, which is responsible for managing the minting and redemption of the GYD stablecoin. The PAMM uses a novel pricing mechanism to maintain the peg of GYD to the US dollar, while also providing liquidity and price stability.

The Gyroscope protocol also includes a **Reserve** component, which is a collection of vaults that hold the underlying assets backing the GYD stablecoin. These vaults can be of different types, such as Balancer pools or Curve pools, and are managed by the Gyroscope **Motherboard** contract.

The Gyroscope protocol is designed to be highly flexible and extensible, allowing for the integration of various third-party DeFi protocols and services.
