# Introduction

Gyroscope is a decentralized protocol that aims to provide a robust stablecoin and automated market maker (AMM) system. At the heart of Gyroscope is the [Primary AMM](/core-contracts/pamm) (PAMM), which is responsible for the pricing mechanism of the protocol's native token, the Gyro Dollar (GYD).

The PAMM contract utilizes a novel pricing curve that aims to maintain the GYD's peg to the US dollar, even in the face of volatile market conditions. This is achieved through a combination of dynamic parameters and advanced mathematical modeling, which is explained in detail in the [PAMM](/core-contracts/pamm) section.

To ensure the safety and stability of the protocol, Gyroscope also includes several other key components:

- [IGyroConfig](/core-contracts/igyro-config): A contract that stores and manages the global configuration settings for the protocol.
- [IGyroVault](/core-contracts/igyro-vault): An interface for the vault components that make up the Gyroscope reserve.
- [IMotherboard](/core-contracts/imotherboard): The central contract that coordinates the different pieces of the protocol.
- [IReserve](/core-contracts/ireserve): The contract responsible for managing token deposits and withdrawals.
- [ISafetyCheck](/core-contracts/isafety-check): An interface for checking the safety of mint and redeem operations.

These core contracts work together to provide a secure and decentralized stablecoin solution, with the [Oracles](/oracles) subsection explaining the price feeds and price checking mechanisms in more detail.

Throughout the Gyroscope protocol, various [Libraries and Utilities](/libraries-utilities) are used to handle common tasks, such as fixed-point arithmetic, flow calculations, and configuration management.

Finally, the [Governance](/governance) section covers the contracts and interfaces related to the protocol's governance model, ensuring that the system can be updated and improved over time.

By understanding these core components, Gyroscope developers and contributors will be well-equipped to build on and enhance the functionality of this decentralized stablecoin ecosystem.
