# Flow

The `Flow` library in the Gyroscope protocol is a utility library that provides functions for calculating **exponential moving sums**. This is particularly useful for tracking the flow of tokens in and out of the protocol's vaults over time.

The primary function in this library is `updateFlow`, which takes the following parameters:

- `flowHistory`: The current value of the flow history.
- `currentBlock`: The current block number.
- `lastSeenBlock`: The block number when the flow was last updated.
- `memoryParam`: The memory parameter, which determines the rate of decay for the exponential moving sum.

The `updateFlow` function calculates the new flow value based on the provided parameters, taking into account the time elapsed since the last update. This allows the protocol to maintain a decaying history of the vault's token flows, which is used for various safety and decision-making mechanisms.

Here's an example of how the `updateFlow` function can be used:

```solidity
uint256 flowHistory = 1000; // Initial flow history value
uint256 currentBlock = block.number;
uint256 lastSeenBlock = 100;
uint256 memoryParam = 0.9e18; // 90% memory

uint256 newFlowHistory = Flow.updateFlow(flowHistory, currentBlock, lastSeenBlock, memoryParam);
// newFlowHistory is now 900, assuming 100 blocks have passed since the last update
```

In this example, the flow history is initially set to 1000. After 100 blocks have passed, the `updateFlow` function is called with the current block number, the last seen block number, and a memory parameter of 0.9. The function calculates the new flow history value of 900, representing a 10% decay in the flow over the 100 block period.

The `Flow` library is an important component of the Gyroscope protocol, as it allows the system to maintain a decaying history of token flows in and out of the vaults, which is crucial for various safety and decision-making mechanisms.
