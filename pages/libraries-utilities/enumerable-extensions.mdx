# EnumerableExtensions

The `EnumerableExtensions` library provides a set of utility functions for working with enumerable data structures, such as [sets](/libraries-utilities/enumerable-extensions) and arrays, in Solidity. This library is particularly useful in the Gyroscope protocol, where we often need to manage collections of addresses, tokens, and other entities.

## Enumerable Sets

One of the key features of the `EnumerableExtensions` library is its support for enumerable sets. An enumerable set is a collection of unique elements that can be efficiently iterated over. This is in contrast to standard Solidity mappings, which do not provide a way to enumerate their keys.

The library provides the following functions for working with enumerable sets:

- `add(set, value)`: Adds a value to the set, if it's not already present.
- `remove(set, value)`: Removes a value from the set, if it's present.
- `contains(set, value)`: Checks if a value is present in the set.
- `length(set)`: Returns the number of elements in the set.
- `at(set, index)`: Returns the element at the specified index in the set.
- `values(set)`: Returns an array containing all the elements in the set.

These functions make it easy to manage collections of entities, such as the list of registered vaults or the list of trusted price oracles in the Gyroscope protocol.

## Enumerable Arrays

In addition to enumerable sets, the `EnumerableExtensions` library also provides utilities for working with enumerable arrays. These functions include:

- `indexOf(array, value)`: Finds the index of a value in an array.
- `contains(array, value)`: Checks if a value is present in an array.
- `remove(array, index)`: Removes an element from an array at a specific index.

These functions can be useful when you need to perform common array operations, such as checking if an element is present or removing an element from a list.

## Examples

Here's an example of how you might use the `EnumerableExtensions` library in the Gyroscope protocol:

```solidity
import "EnumerableExtensions.sol";

contract GYROMaintainer {
    using EnumerableSet for EnumerableSet.AddressSet;
    EnumerableSet.AddressSet private registeredVaults;

    function registerVault(address vaultAddress) external {
        registeredVaults.add(vaultAddress);
    }

    function deregisterVault(address vaultAddress) external {
        registeredVaults.remove(vaultAddress);
    }

    function listRegisteredVaults() external view returns (address[] memory) {
        return registeredVaults.values();
    }
}
```

In this example, we use the `EnumerableSet` from the `EnumerableExtensions` library to manage a set of registered vaults. We can easily add, remove, and list the registered vaults using the provided functions.

The `EnumerableExtensions` library is a valuable tool in the Gyroscope protocol, as it allows us to efficiently manage collections of entities without relying on error-prone and gas-expensive mappings.
