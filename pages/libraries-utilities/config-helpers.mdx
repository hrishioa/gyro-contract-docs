# ConfigHelpers

The `ConfigHelpers` library provides a set of helper functions for interacting with the [IGyroConfig](/igyro-config) contract, which is responsible for storing and managing the global configuration settings of the Gyroscope protocol.

These helpers simplify the process of reading and writing configuration values, making it easier for other contracts to access and update the protocol's settings.

## Getting Configuration Values

The `ConfigHelpers` library offers several functions for retrieving configuration values from the [IGyroConfig](/igyro-config) contract:

- `getUint(IGyroConfig config, bytes32 key)`: Returns the value associated with the given `key` as a `uint256`.
- `getUint(IGyroConfig config, bytes32 key, uint256 defaultValue)`: Returns the value associated with the given `key`, or the provided `defaultValue` if the key is not found.
- `getAddress(IGyroConfig config, bytes32 key)`: Returns the address value associated with the given `key`.
- `getAddress(IGyroConfig config, bytes32 key, address defaultValue)`: Returns the address value associated with the given `key`, or the provided `defaultValue` if the key is not found.

Here's an example of how to use these functions:

<Callout type="info">
The `IGyroConfig` contract is passed as a parameter to these functions, as they are designed to be used across multiple contracts in the Gyroscope protocol.
</Callout>

```solidity
IGyroConfig config = IGyroConfig(0x...); // Address of the IGyroConfig contract

uint256 xuBar = ConfigHelpers.getUint(config, keccak256("xuBar"));
address motherboard = ConfigHelpers.getAddress(config, keccak256("motherboard"));
```

## Setting Configuration Values

The `ConfigHelpers` library also provides functions for setting configuration values in the [IGyroConfig](/igyro-config) contract:

- `setUint(IGyroConfig config, bytes32 key, uint256 newValue)`: Sets the value associated with the given `key` to the `newValue`.
- `setAddress(IGyroConfig config, bytes32 key, address newValue)`: Sets the address value associated with the given `key` to the `newValue`.

Here's an example of how to use these functions:

```solidity
IGyroConfig config = IGyroConfig(0x...); // Address of the IGyroConfig contract

ConfigHelpers.setUint(config, keccak256("alphaBar"), 0.5e18);
ConfigHelpers.setAddress(config, keccak256("motherboard"), 0x...); // Address of the motherboard contract
```

<Callout type="warning">
Remember that setting configuration values is typically a privileged action, controlled by the Gyroscope protocol's governance. Make sure you have the necessary permissions before calling these functions.
</Callout>

## Utility Functions

The `ConfigHelpers` library also includes some utility functions to simplify working with the [IGyroConfig](/igyro-config) contract:

- `hasKey(IGyroConfig config, bytes32 key)`: Returns `true` if the given `key` is present in the configuration.
- `listKeys(IGyroConfig config)`: Returns an array of all the keys currently set in the configuration.
- `getConfigMeta(IGyroConfig config, bytes32 key)`: Returns the metadata associated with the given `key`, including its data type and whether it's frozen.

These functions can be useful when iterating over the protocol's configuration or checking the status of specific settings.

By using the `ConfigHelpers` library, you can easily interact with the [IGyroConfig](/igyro-config) contract and manage the Gyroscope protocol's global configuration settings from within your contracts. This helps maintain a consistent and organized approach to configuration management across the entire system.
