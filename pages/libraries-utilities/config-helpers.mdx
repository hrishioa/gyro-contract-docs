# ConfigHelpers

The `ConfigHelpers` library provides a set of helper functions for interacting with the Gyroscope configuration stored in the `IGyroConfig` contract. This contract serves as the central repository for all global configuration settings used throughout the Gyroscope protocol.

The `ConfigHelpers` library is designed to simplify the process of retrieving, setting, and updating configuration values, making it easier for developers to work with the Gyroscope protocol's configuration system.

## Retrieving Configuration Values

The `ConfigHelpers` library provides several functions for retrieving configuration values from the `IGyroConfig` contract:

- `getUint(bytes32 key)`: Retrieves the `uint256` value associated with the specified `key`.
- `getUint(bytes32 key, uint256 defaultValue)`: Retrieves the `uint256` value associated with the specified `key`, or the provided `defaultValue` if the key is not found.
- `getAddress(bytes32 key)`: Retrieves the `address` value associated with the specified `key`.
- `getAddress(bytes32 key, address defaultValue)`: Retrieves the `address` value associated with the specified `key`, or the provided `defaultValue` if the key is not found.

Here's an example of how you might use these functions:

```solidity
bytes32 key = keccak256(abi.encodePacked("PAMM_ALPHA_BAR"));
uint256 alphaBar = ConfigHelpers.getUint(key);
```

In this example, we're retrieving the value associated with the `"PAMM_ALPHA_BAR"` configuration key, which is likely the alpha bar parameter used in the PAMM (Primary AMM) contract.

<Callout type="info">
The `ConfigHelpers` library uses the `keccak256` hash function to convert a human-readable configuration key into the corresponding `bytes32` value used by the `IGyroConfig` contract. This ensures that the keys are standardized and consistent throughout the protocol.
</Callout>

## Setting Configuration Values

The `ConfigHelpers` library also provides functions for setting configuration values in the `IGyroConfig` contract:

- `setUint(bytes32 key, uint256 newValue)`: Sets the `uint256` value associated with the specified `key` to the provided `newValue`.
- `setAddress(bytes32 key, address newValue)`: Sets the `address` value associated with the specified `key` to the provided `newValue`.

Here's an example of how you might use these functions:

```solidity
bytes32 key = keccak256(abi.encodePacked("PAMM_ALPHA_BAR"));
ConfigHelpers.setUint(key, 0.5e18);
```

In this example, we're setting the `"PAMM_ALPHA_BAR"` configuration key to the value of `0.5e18`, which is likely the new alpha bar parameter for the PAMM contract.

<Callout type="warning">
Configuration changes in the `IGyroConfig` contract are typically governed by the Gyroscope protocol's governance system. Developers should ensure that they have the necessary permissions and approvals before attempting to update configuration values.
</Callout>

## Unset and Freeze Configuration Keys

The `ConfigHelpers` library also provides functions for unset and freeze configuration keys in the `IGyroConfig` contract:

- `unset(bytes32 key)`: Removes the configuration value associated with the specified `key`.
- `freeze(bytes32 key)`: Freezes the configuration value associated with the specified `key`, making it impossible to update or unset the value.

These functions can be useful for managing the protocol's configuration over time, such as when certain configuration values become obsolete or need to be permanently locked.

<Callout type="info">
Unset and freeze operations on configuration keys are also typically governed by the Gyroscope protocol's governance system. Developers should ensure that they have the necessary permissions and approvals before attempting to unset or freeze configuration keys.
</Callout>

## Conclusion

The `ConfigHelpers` library provides a convenient and standardized way for developers to interact with the Gyroscope protocol's configuration system. By abstracting away the low-level details of the `IGyroConfig` contract, the `ConfigHelpers` library helps to simplify the process of managing configuration values, making it easier to build applications and services on top of the Gyroscope protocol.
