# ConfigHelpers

This library provides helper functions for interacting with the Gyroscope configuration contract, `IGyroConfig`. The `IGyroConfig` contract is the central hub for storing and managing global configuration settings used throughout the Gyroscope protocol.

The `ConfigHelpers` library makes it easier to read and update these configuration values by providing a set of utility functions. This helps ensure consistency and reduces boilerplate code when working with the global configuration.

## Reading Configuration Values

The `IGyroConfig` interface provides various methods for fetching configuration values, such as `getUint()`, `getAddress()`, and `getConfigMeta()`. The `ConfigHelpers` library wraps these methods to provide a more convenient API.

For example, to fetch the current value of the `alphaBar` parameter, you can use the following code:

```solidity
uint256 alphaBar = ConfigHelpers.getUint(keccak256("alphaBar"));
```

Here, we're using the `getUint()` helper function to fetch the value associated with the `"alphaBar"` key in the configuration contract.

<Callout type="info">
The configuration keys are hashed using the `keccak256()` function to generate a unique 32-byte identifier. This helps ensure that the keys are unique and can be looked up efficiently in the contract's storage.
</Callout>

Similarly, you can use the `getAddress()` helper to fetch the value of an address-typed configuration parameter:

```solidity
address motherboard = ConfigHelpers.getAddress(keccak256("motherboard"));
```

The `getConfigMeta()` helper function can be used to retrieve additional metadata about a configuration parameter, such as whether it is frozen or what its data type is:

```solidity
(uint8 dataType, bool isFrozen) = ConfigHelpers.getConfigMeta(keccak256("alphaBar"));
```

## Updating Configuration Values

In addition to reading configuration values, the `ConfigHelpers` library also provides functions for updating them. This is particularly useful when implementing governance-controlled features, where protocol parameters need to be changed over time.

<Steps>
### Step 1

To update the value of a configuration parameter, you can use the `setUint()` or `setAddress()` helper functions:

```solidity
ConfigHelpers.setUint(keccak256("alphaBar"), newAlphaBarValue);
```

### Step 2

If you need to remove a configuration parameter, you can use the `unset()` helper:

```solidity
ConfigHelpers.unset(keccak256("alphaBar"));
```

### Step 3

Finally, if a configuration parameter needs to be permanently locked, you can use the `freeze()` helper to prevent it from being updated or unset in the future:

```solidity
ConfigHelpers.freeze(keccak256("alphaBar"));
```
</Steps>

By using the `ConfigHelpers` library, you can simplify the process of managing the Gyroscope protocol's global configuration, making it easier to maintain and evolve the system over time.

## Example: Updating the Motherboard Address

Let's consider an example of how you might use the `ConfigHelpers` library to update the address of the Gyroscope Motherboard contract.

The Motherboard contract is the central hub that coordinates the various components of the Gyroscope protocol. It's important that this address can be updated as needed, such as when a new Motherboard contract is deployed.

Here's how you might update the Motherboard address using the `ConfigHelpers` library:

```solidity
// Get the current Motherboard address
address currentMotherboardAddress = ConfigHelpers.getAddress(keccak256("motherboard"));

// Update the Motherboard address to a new value
ConfigHelpers.setAddress(keccak256("motherboard"), newMotherboardAddress);

// Verify that the update was successful
address updatedMotherboardAddress = ConfigHelpers.getAddress(keccak256("motherboard"));
require(updatedMotherboardAddress == newMotherboardAddress, "Motherboard address update failed");
```

In this example, we first retrieve the current Motherboard address using the `getAddress()` helper. We then update the address using the `setAddress()` helper, passing in the new address we want to use. Finally, we verify that the update was successful by fetching the updated address and comparing it to the new value we set.

By using the `ConfigHelpers` library, we can simplify the process of updating critical protocol parameters like the Motherboard address, making it easier to manage the Gyroscope protocol as it evolves over time.
