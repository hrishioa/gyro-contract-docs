# LogExpMath

The `LogExpMath` library provides a set of mathematical functions that utilize logarithms and exponentiation. These functions are essential for the Gyroscope protocol's primary AMM pricing mechanism, which relies on complex mathematical calculations.

## Logarithmic and Exponential Functions

The library includes several functions that perform logarithmic and exponential operations:

- `log(uint256 x)`: Calculates the natural logarithm of `x`.
- `exp(uint256 x)`: Calculates the exponential function of `x`.
- `intPowDown(uint256 base, uint256 exponent)`: Calculates the integer power of `base` raised to the `exponent`, rounding down the result.

These functions are used extensively throughout the Gyroscope protocol, particularly in the [PAMM contract](/core-contracts/pamm) for computing various pricing parameters.

<Callout type="info">
The logarithmic and exponential functions in `LogExpMath` are designed to work with fixed-point decimal numbers, which are represented using the [FixedPoint library](/libraries-utilities/fixed-point). This allows for precise calculations while avoiding the potential for overflow and underflow errors.

## Example Usage

Let's look at an example of how the `LogExpMath` functions can be used in the context of the Gyroscope protocol:

<Steps>
### Step 1
In the `computeAlpha` function of the `PrimaryAMMV1` contract, we need to calculate the value of `alpha`, which is a key parameter in the pricing mechanism. The formula for `alpha` involves logarithmic and exponential operations:

```solidity
function computeAlpha(
    uint256 ba,
    uint256 ya,
    uint256 thetaBar,
    uint256 alphaBar
) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    uint256 ra = ba.divDown(ya);
    uint256 alphaMin = alphaBar.divDown(ya);
    uint256 alphaHat;
    if (ra >= (ONE + thetaBar) / 2) {
        alphaHat = TWO.mulDown(ONE - ra).divDown(ya);
    } else {
        uint256 numerator = (ONE - thetaBar)**2;
        uint256 denominator = ba - thetaBar.mulDown(ya);
        alphaHat = numerator / (denominator * 2);
    }
    return alphaHat.max(alphaMin);
}
```

### Step 2
In this example, we use the `LogExpMath` functions to calculate the values of `ra`, `alphaMin`, and `alphaHat`. The `divDown` and `mulDown` functions from the `FixedPoint` library are used to perform the necessary fixed-point arithmetic operations.

The `exp` function is used to calculate `(ONE - thetaBar)**2`, and the `log` function is used to compute `ra = ba.divDown(ya)`. These values are then used in the subsequent calculations to determine the final value of `alpha`.

By utilizing the logarithmic and exponential functions provided by the `LogExpMath` library, the Gyroscope protocol can accurately and efficiently perform the complex mathematical operations required for its pricing mechanism.

The `LogExpMath` library is a crucial component of the Gyroscope protocol, enabling the precise calculation of parameters that are essential for the protocol's overall functionality and performance.
