# FixedPoint

The FixedPoint library in the Gyroscope protocol provides a set of utilities for performing fixed-point arithmetic operations. Fixed-point numbers are a way of representing decimal values using integer types, which is particularly useful in smart contract development where floating-point arithmetic is not natively supported.

The FixedPoint library defines a number of useful functions for working with fixed-point numbers, including:

- `divDown`: Performs a division operation, rounding down the result.
- `divUp`: Performs a division operation, rounding up the result.
- `mulDown`: Performs a multiplication operation, rounding down the result.
- `mulUp`: Performs a multiplication operation, rounding up the result.
- `absSub`: Calculates the absolute difference between two fixed-point numbers.

These functions are used extensively throughout the Gyroscope protocol, particularly in the [PAMM (PrimaryAMMV1)](/core-contracts/pamm) contract, which is responsible for the core AMM pricing mechanism.

For example, the `computeReserveFixedParams` function in the PAMM contract uses the `divDown` and `mulDown` functions from the FixedPoint library to calculate the reserve value for a given redemption level:

```solidity
function computeReserveFixedParams(
    uint256 x,
    uint256 ba,
    uint256 ya,
    uint256 alpha,
    uint256 xu,
    uint256 xl
) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    if (x <= xu) {
        return ba - x;
    }
    if (x <= xl) {
        return ba - x + (alpha * (x - xu).squareDown()) / TWO;
    }
    // x > xl:
    uint256 rl = ONE - alpha.mulDown(xl - xu);
    return rl.mulDown(ya - x);
}
```

In this example, the `mulDown` function is used to ensure that the calculations are performed with the appropriate rounding behavior, which is important for maintaining the stability and correctness of the AMM pricing algorithm.

The FixedPoint library also provides a number of utility functions, such as `intPowDown` and `sqrt`, which are used throughout the Gyroscope protocol for various calculations and transformations.

Overall, the FixedPoint library is a crucial component of the Gyroscope protocol, providing a reliable and efficient way of performing fixed-point arithmetic operations that are essential for the proper functioning of the AMM and other protocol components.
